Sukyoung Won -shows how microrobot swarms can work together to complete challenging tasks

We can model the following features:

    Microrobot Representation: Each microrobot has a magnetization profile and position.
    Swarm Behavior: Implement simple interactions based on magnetization to simulate swarm assembly into head-to-tail (HT), slipped-co-facial (SC), and face-to-face (FF) configurations.
    Task Simulation: Simulate simple tasks like cargo transport or obstacle climbing.

1. Microrobot Fabrication and Magnetization

    Mass Production: Achieved through in-situ replica molding and magnetization using NdFeB particles in an epoxy matrix.
    Magnetization Profiles: Cuboid microrobots were programmed with magnetization directions at 0°, 45°, and 90°, enabling:
        Head-to-Tail (HT): High aspect ratio for climbing and throwing.
        Slipped-Co-Facial (SC): High packing density for cargo transport.
        Face-to-Face (FF): High stiffness for obstacle lifting and liquid metal shaping.

2. Swarm Behavior and Configurations

    Magnetic Assembly:
        Magnetic dipole-dipole interactions drive assembly.
        Assemblies form structures minimizing inter-dipolar potential energy.
    Contact Area-to-Volume Ratio (CA/V):
        Higher CA/V increases magnetic force and assembly stiffness.
        HT has the lowest CA/V, FF the highest.

3. Task Execution by Swarms

    Obstacle Climbing and Walking: HT swarms climbed obstacles 5 times their height due to their long structure.
    Self-Throwing: HT assemblies threw microrobots over obstacles using centrifugal forces from rotational motion.
    Cargo Transport:
        SC swarms formed 2D rafts for floating and transported items 2,000 times their weight.
    Liquid Metal Shaping: FF swarms modified high-surface-tension liquids due to their strong assembly stiffness.
    Tube Unclogging: FF swarms cleared clogged tubes with combined spinning and orbital dragging motions.

4. Autonomous Swarm Intelligence

    Swarm Control:
        Actuated by rotating permanent magnets.
        External magnetic field controlled assembly motions, including:
            Spinning: Rotational motion driven by misalignment torque.
            Orbital Dragging: High-speed dragging along an orbital path.
    Guiding Systems:
        Guided organisms like ants using SC swarms for spinning and FF swarms for blocking larger creatures like superworms.

5. Potential Applications

    Biomedical Uses: Targeted drug delivery, minimally invasive surgeries.
    Engineering Tasks: Cargo transport, obstacle navigation, and electrical connections.
    Future Scope:
        Autonomous target searching.
        Real-time position feedback and adaptive task execution.
